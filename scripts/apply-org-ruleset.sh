#   ./scripts/apply-org-ruleset.sh [--dry-run]
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS IS THE HIGHEST-BLAST-RADIUS COMMAND IN THIS REPO. IT IS DELIBERATELY HARD TO RUN.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# It exists as a SEPARATE SCRIPT on purpose. It used to be `apply-rulesets.sh --org` — one flag
# away from the command you run on every new repo. That adjacency was the whole problem:
#
#   * a fat-finger or a stray tab-complete could turn a routine per-repo apply into an org-wide one
#   * `[y/N]` is answered by reflex; `y` is muscle memory, not consent
#   * `apply-rulesets.sh --org --yes` lived in shell history forever, one Up-arrow from re-firing
#
# So the three defences here are, in order:
#
#   1. IT IS ITS OWN SCRIPT. There is no flag on the routine command that reaches this code. You
#      cannot get here by accident from `apply-rulesets.sh`.
#
#   2. THERE IS NO `--yes`, AND NO NON-INTERACTIVE PATH AT ALL. You must type a challenge phrase,
#      in full, that names the LIVE repo count. It is read from stdin, so it never lands in shell
#      history — there is nothing to Up-arrow into. And because the count is interpolated live, a
#      phrase memorised or copy-pasted from a doc goes STALE the moment the org grows. This script
#      must never run from CI, and it cannot.
#
#   3. A BRICKING PAYLOAD IS REFUSED OUTRIGHT, not warned about. See the check below.
#
# Why so much ceremony: this ruleset targets repository_name ~ALL with enforcement=active and
# bypass_actors=[]. Applied carelessly it takes push AND merge away from every repo in Avenue-Z
# at once — including the ~60 that never came from this template.
