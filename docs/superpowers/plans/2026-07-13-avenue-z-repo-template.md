# Avenue-Z Repo Template Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build `Avenue-Z/repo-template` — a public GitHub template repository with `main`/`staging`/`dev` branches whose stack-agnostic core carries the org's conventions, and whose `init-repo.sh` turns a fresh copy into a working Python or Node repo.

**Architecture:** The committed root is stack-agnostic (gitignore, env example, docs tree, governance files, base-branch guard, secret scan). Language-specific files live in `templates/{python,node}/` and are copied to the root by `scripts/init-repo.sh`, which then deletes `templates/`, commits once, pushes `dev`, and only then cuts `staging` and `main` from the cleaned tree. `scripts/apply-rulesets.sh` applies branch protection where the GitHub plan allows and prints what it skipped where it does not.

**Tech Stack:** Bash (`gh` CLI, git), GitHub Actions, gitleaks, pre-commit; `templates/python` = hatchling + pytest + ruff + mypy; `templates/node` = vitest + eslint + tsc.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-avenue-z-repo-template-design.md` — read it before Task 1. Its 15 success criteria are the acceptance tests; each is mapped to a task below.

## Global Constraints

- **Org:** `Avenue-Z`. **Repo:** `repo-template`. **Visibility: public** (template only; generated repos are private).
- **Default branch: `dev`.** Branch model: `feat/* | fix/* | docs/* | chore/* | ci/* | dependabot/*` → `dev` → `staging` → `main`.
- **Every shell script:** `#!/usr/bin/env bash` + `set -euo pipefail`.
- **`gh api` failure handling:** HTTP 404 is an *answer* (warn, continue). Any other non-zero exit is *"could not verify"* → **stop and say why**. Never downgrade a control silently.
- **Required status-check names in rulesets must equal the `jobs.<id>` key in the workflow** — a mismatched name hangs *pending* forever and makes the PR unmergeable.
- **The stack-agnostic core has no `ci` check.** Only `guard-base-branch` and `secret-scan` may be required on the template repo itself. `ci` is added to a generated repo only *after* `ci.yml` is copied in.
- **`.gitignore` env block ordering is load-bearing:** `!.env.example` MUST come after `.env.*`.
- **No secrets, ever.** No real credential values in any committed file, including examples.
- Python floor: `>=3.11`. Node floor: `>=20`.
- Commit style: `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `chore:` / `ci:` / `test:`.

## File Structure

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `.gitignore` | Union denylist: OS, Python, Node, `.claude/`, env block, credential block |
| `.env.example` | The only committed env file; declares + comments every var |
| `README.md` | what-this-is → Stack → Setup → Run → Tests → Deploy → Docs |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Durable agent context; explicitly forbids volatile state |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Branch flow, commit conventions, sync check |
| `SECURITY.md` | Vuln reporting + never-commit-credentials |
| `LICENSE` | Proprietary / UNLICENSED |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | gitleaks hook (local, skippable — CI is the real gate) |
| `.github/workflows/guard-base-branch.yml` | Job id **`guard-base-branch`**. Enforces the base matrix; fails closed |
| `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml` | Job id **`secret-scan`**. gitleaks on PRs — the enforced boundary |
| `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | Checklist |
| `.github/CODEOWNERS.tmpl` | NOT live. `init-repo.sh` writes a real `CODEOWNERS` or drops this |
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | pip + npm + actions, `target-branch: dev` |
| `.github/rulesets/repo-ruleset.json` | Per-repo protection; review count 0; core checks only |
| `.github/rulesets/org-ruleset.json` | Org-wide equivalent; committed, not applied (needs Team) |
| `scripts/init-repo.sh` | Stack select, CODEOWNERS resolve, cleanup, commit, branch lineage |
| `scripts/apply-rulesets.sh` | Apply what the plan allows; report what it skipped |
| `tests/test_gitignore.sh` | Criterion 10 |
| `tests/test_init_repo.sh` | Criteria 1, 2, 7, 11, 15 |
| `tests/test_apply_rulesets.sh` | Criterion 6 |
| `tests/lib.sh` | Shared `assert_*` helpers |
| `templates/python/**` | pyproject (hatchling, ruff, mypy, pytest), `ci.yml` (job id **`ci`**), Dockerfile, src/tests skeleton |
| `templates/node/**` | package.json, tsconfig, eslint, `ci.yml` (job id **`ci`**), src/tests skeleton |
| `docs/{superpowers/{plans,specs,handoffs},notes}/` | Each with `.gitkeep` + a one-line `README.md` |

**Criteria → task map:** 10→T1 · 6→T8 · 1,2,7,11,15→T7/T9/T10 · 4,14→T3 · 9→T4 · 8→T7 · 3→T7 · 5,12→T11 · 13→T12

---

### Task 1: Repo skeleton, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`

**Files:**
- Create: `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `tests/lib.sh`, `tests/test_gitignore.sh`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: `tests/lib.sh` exporting `assert_eq <expected> <actual> <msg>`, `assert_ignored <path>`, `assert_trackable <path>`, `pass <msg>`, `fail <msg>`. Every later test file sources it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — `tests/lib.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Shared assertions for the repo-template test scripts.
set -euo pipefail

FAILURES=0

pass() { printf '  ok   %s\n' "$1"; }
fail() { printf '  FAIL %s\n' "$1"; FAILURES=$((FAILURES + 1)); }

assert_eq() { # <expected> <actual> <msg>
  if [ "$1" = "$2" ]; then pass "$3"; else fail "$3 (expected '$1', got '$2')"; fi
}

# git check-ignore exits 0 when the path IS ignored, 1 when it is not.
assert_ignored() {
  if git check-ignore -q "$1"; then pass "$1 is ignored"; else fail "$1 should be ignored"; fi
}

assert_trackable() {
  if git check-ignore -q "$1"; then fail "$1 should be trackable but is ignored"; else pass "$1 is trackable"; fi
}

finish() {
  if [ "$FAILURES" -eq 0 ]; then printf '\nALL PASS\n'; exit 0; fi
  printf '\n%d FAILURE(S)\n' "$FAILURES"; exit 1
}
```

Then `tests/test_gitignore.sh` — **criterion 10**:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."
# shellcheck source=lib.sh
source tests/lib.sh

echo "gitignore: env block ordering"
touch .env .env.local .env.production .env.example

assert_ignored   .env
assert_ignored   .env.local
assert_ignored   .env.production
assert_trackable .env.example          # THE trap: a negation before .env.* silently ignores this

echo "gitignore: credential block"
touch sa-key.json client_secrets.json token.json google-credentials.json my-service-account.json
for f in sa-key.json client_secrets.json token.json google-credentials.json my-service-account.json; do
  assert_ignored "$f"
done

rm -f .env .env.local .env.production .env.example sa-key.json client_secrets.json \
      token.json google-credentials.json my-service-account.json
finish
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

```bash
chmod +x tests/lib.sh tests/test_gitignore.sh && ./tests/test_gitignore.sh
```
Expected: FAIL — no `.gitignore` exists yet, so every `assert_ignored` fails and `assert_trackable .env.example` passes vacuously.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write `.gitignore`**

```gitignore
# --- OS ---
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# --- Python ---
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*.egg-info/
.venv/
venv/
build/
dist/
.pytest_cache/
.mypy_cache/
.ruff_cache/
.coverage
htmlcov/

# --- Node ---
node_modules/
.next/
.vercel/
*.tsbuildinfo

# --- Agent config (shared agent config lives in Avenue-Z/claude-marketplace) ---
.claude/

# --- Env. ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: the negation MUST follow .env.* ---
# .env.* matches .env.example, so !.env.example placed earlier silently does nothing.
.env
.env.local
.env.*
!.env.example

# --- Credentials. A denylist, and denylists leak: gitleaks is the real control. ---
*service-account*.json
sa-key*.json
client_secrets.json
token.json
google-credentials.json
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test — expect PASS**

```bash
./tests/test_gitignore.sh
```
Expected: `ALL PASS`. If `.env.example` reports ignored, the negation is misordered.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write `.env.example`**

```bash
# Copy to .env.local and fill in. NEVER commit .env.local.
#   cp .env.example .env.local
#
# Every variable this project reads must be declared here, commented, with a blank
# or dummy value. This file is the env contract; do not document vars in prose only.

# --- Core ---
# Deployment environment: local | staging | production
APP_ENV=local

# --- Google Cloud (service-account auth; see SECURITY.md) ---
# Absolute path to the service-account JSON. The file itself is gitignored.
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=
# user = local OAuth flow; service_account = Cloud Run
AUTH_MODE=user

# --- Secrets (fill in .env.local; never here) ---
# API_KEY=
# SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=
# DATABASE_URL=
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add .gitignore .env.example tests/lib.sh tests/test_gitignore.sh
git commit -m "feat: gitignore with ordered env block, env example, test helpers"
```

---

### Task 2: Docs tree and governance files

**Files:**
- Create: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE`
- Create: `docs/superpowers/{plans,specs,handoffs}/{.gitkeep,README.md}`, `docs/notes/{.gitkeep,README.md}`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the canonical statement of the branch flow. Task 3's workflow and Task 7's script must not contradict it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the docs tree**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/superpowers/plans docs/superpowers/specs docs/superpowers/handoffs docs/notes
touch docs/superpowers/plans/.gitkeep docs/superpowers/specs/.gitkeep \
      docs/superpowers/handoffs/.gitkeep docs/notes/.gitkeep
echo "Implementation plans. One per feature: YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md" > docs/superpowers/plans/README.md
echo "Design specs, written before the plan. YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md" > docs/superpowers/specs/README.md
echo "Session handoffs for picking up in-flight work. YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md" > docs/superpowers/handoffs/README.md
echo "Dated working notes. YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md — NOT a dumping ground for docs/ root." > docs/notes/README.md
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `CONTRIBUTING.md`**

```markdown
# Contributing

## Branch flow

    feat/* | fix/* | docs/* | chore/* | ci/* | dependabot/*  →  dev  →  staging  →  main

- **`dev`** — integration branch, and the default. Open your PR here.
- **`staging`** — pre-prod soak / QA. Receives PRs from `dev` only.
- **`main`** — production. Receives PRs from `staging` only.

`guard-base-branch` fails any PR whose base is wrong for its head, and **fails closed on an
unrecognized branch prefix**. Need a new prefix? Add it to the matrix in a PR.

## Never push directly to main

Every change reaches `main` through the chain above. No exceptions.

## Start every session by syncing

    git fetch --all --prune
    git log origin/dev..HEAD        # what you have that origin does not

## Commits

`feat:` `fix:` `docs:` `chore:` `ci:` `test:` — imperative mood, one logical change.

## Before you open a PR

- Tests pass.
- Lint passes (`ruff check` / `npm run lint`).
- No credentials. `secret-scan` will fail the PR; a key that reached the remote is **burned and
  must be rotated**, even if the PR is never merged. See SECURITY.md.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write `CLAUDE.md`**

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

> **This file holds DURABLE context only.**
> Do NOT put volatile state here — open branches, recent history, "as of <date>" lists, in-flight
> work. It rots within days, and a stale CLAUDE.md is worse than none: an agent will act on it.
> Volatile state belongs in `docs/notes/` or `docs/superpowers/handoffs/`.

## What this is
<!-- TODO: one or two sentences. What does this project do, for whom? -->

## Stack
<!-- TODO: language, framework, datastore, deploy target -->

## Layout
<!-- TODO: the 3-6 directories that matter and what each holds -->

## Commands
| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install | <!-- TODO --> |
| Test | <!-- TODO --> |
| Lint | <!-- TODO --> |
| Run | <!-- TODO --> |

## Env
Declared in `.env.example`. Copy to `.env.local`. Never commit `.env.local`.

## Workflow rules
1. Branch flow is `feat/* → dev → staging → main`. **Never push directly to `main`.**
2. Sync before you start: `git fetch --all --prune && git log origin/dev..HEAD`.
3. Verify before claiming done — run the tests and read the output. Do not assert a pass you
   have not seen.
4. Never commit credentials. `.gitignore` is a denylist and denylists leak; `secret-scan` is the
   real control.

## Project rules
<!-- TODO: the rules specific to THIS repo. Keep them durable. -->
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Write `SECURITY.md`**

```markdown
# Security

## Reporting

Email **paul.ramirez@avenuez.com**. Do not open a public issue.

## Never commit credentials

Service-account JSON, API keys, tokens, `.env.local` — none of it belongs in git.

`.gitignore` blocks the credential filenames we have thought of. That is a **denylist, and
denylists leak** — it is a convenience, not a control. The controls are:

| Control | Boundary |
|---|---|
| gitleaks pre-commit hook | Local, and **skippable with `--no-verify`** |
| `secret-scan` CI job | **Merge** — it fails the PR |

Note what this means: nothing stops the *push*. Private repos on the Free plan have no server-side
push protection. A credential can be committed, pushed to a branch, and reach the remote's object
store — where it survives even if the PR is closed unmerged.

**A key that reached the remote is burned. Rotate it.** Removing the commit is not sufficient.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Write `LICENSE`**

```

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL. This software is the confidential and proprietary
information of Avenue Z, Inc. It is not licensed for use, copying, modification,

```

- [ ] **Step 6: Write `README.md`**

```markdown
# <!-- TODO: repo-name -->

<!-- TODO: one sentence. What is this and who is it for? -->

## Stack
<!-- TODO -->

## Setup

    git clone git@github.com:Avenue-Z/<repo>.git && cd <repo>
    cp .env.example .env.local    # then fill it in
    <!-- TODO: install command -->
    pre-commit install            # installs the gitleaks hook

## Run
<!-- TODO -->

## Tests

## Deploy

- `docs/superpowers/plans/` — implementation plans
- `docs/notes/` — dated working notes
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — branch flow. **Never push directly to `main`.**
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add README.md CLAUDE.md CONTRIBUTING.md SECURITY.md LICENSE docs/
git commit -m "docs: README, CLAUDE, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, LICENSE, docs tree"
```

---

### Task 3: `guard-base-branch` workflow — criteria 4, 14

**Files:**
- Create: `.github/workflows/guard-base-branch.yml`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the branch flow from `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Task 2).
- Produces: a status check whose name is exactly **`guard-base-branch`** (the `jobs.` key). Tasks 6 and 11 require this name verbatim in the rulesets — a mismatch hangs pending forever.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the workflow**

The job id **must** be `guard-base-branch`.

```yaml
name: guard-base-branch

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, reopened, synchronize]

jobs:
  guard-base-branch:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Enforce the base-branch matrix
        env:
          HEAD_REF: ${{ github.head_ref }}
          BASE_REF: ${{ github.base_ref }}
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail
          echo "PR: ${HEAD_REF} -> ${BASE_REF}"

          case "${HEAD_REF}" in
            feat/*|fix/*|docs/*|chore/*|ci/*|dependabot/*) want=dev ;;
            dev)                                           want=staging ;;
            staging)                                       want=main ;;
            *)
              echo "::error::Unrecognized branch prefix '${HEAD_REF}'. This guard FAILS CLOSED."
              echo "Allowed: feat/ fix/ docs/ chore/ ci/ dependabot/ — or dev, staging."
              echo "Need a new prefix? Add it to the matrix in .github/workflows/guard-base-branch.yml."
              exit 1
              ;;
          esac

          if [ "${BASE_REF}" != "${want}" ]; then
            echo "::error::'${HEAD_REF}' must target '${want}', not '${BASE_REF}'. See CONTRIBUTING.md."
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "OK: '${HEAD_REF}' -> '${BASE_REF}'"
```

`dependabot/*` is in the matrix deliberately: without it, fail-closed would red-X every dependabot PR, and a fresh repo would greet its owner with a wall of red. Task 5's `dependabot.yml` sets `target-branch: dev` to match.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify the job name matches what the rulesets will require**

```bash
grep -A1 '^jobs:' .github/workflows/guard-base-branch.yml
```
Expected: the next line is `  guard-base-branch:`. This exact string goes in the rulesets in Task 6.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add .github/workflows/guard-base-branch.yml
git commit -m "ci: guard-base-branch — enforce base matrix, fail closed, allow dependabot"
```

Criteria 4 and 14 are verified live in Task 11 (real PRs against the template repo).

---

### Task 4: Secret scanning — criterion 9

**Files:**
- Create: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: a status check named exactly **`secret-scan`** (the `jobs.` key), required by the rulesets in Task 6.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `.pre-commit-config.yaml`**

```yaml
# Local hooks. SKIPPABLE with `git commit --no-verify` — the CI job is the real gate.
# Install once:  pre-commit install
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
    rev: v8.21.2
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v5.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: check-merge-conflict
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: trailing-whitespace
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml`**

Job id **must** be `secret-scan`.

```yaml
name: secret-scan

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [dev, staging, main]

jobs:
  secret-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0          # gitleaks needs history to scan the PR's commits
      - name: gitleaks
        uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify the hook fires on a planted credential**

```bash
pre-commit install
PROBE="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPL"X   # built at runtime: a literal here would trip our own secret-scan
printf 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=%s\n' "$PROBE" > /tmp/leak.env
cp /tmp/leak.env ./leak-test.env && git add -f leak-test.env
git commit -m "test: should be blocked" || echo "BLOCKED AS EXPECTED"
```
Expected: gitleaks blocks the commit. Then clean up:

```bash
git reset HEAD leak-test.env && rm -f leak-test.env
```

The bypass path (`--no-verify` → caught by `secret-scan` in CI) is verified live in Task 11. That is the guarantee that actually matters; the hook is a courtesy.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add .pre-commit-config.yaml .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml
git commit -m "ci: gitleaks pre-commit hook and secret-scan job"
```

---

### Task 5: PR template, CODEOWNERS template, dependabot

**Files:**
- Create: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/CODEOWNERS.tmpl`, `.github/dependabot.yml`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `.github/CODEOWNERS.tmpl` containing the literal token `@Avenue-Z/TEAM_SLUG`. Task 7's `init-repo.sh` substitutes that exact string, or deletes the file. It must never be named `CODEOWNERS` — a live file with an unresolvable team is **silently ignored** by GitHub and would ship enforcement theater.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`**

```markdown
## What

<!-- One sentence. What changes, and why? -->

## Base branch

<!-- feat/fix/docs/chore/ci -> dev  |  dev -> staging  |  staging -> main -->

## Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass, and I read the output.
- [ ] Lint passes.
- [ ] No credentials. (If one ever reached the remote: rotate it — removing the commit is not enough.)
- [ ] Docs updated if behavior changed.
- [ ] No volatile state added to `CLAUDE.md`.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `.github/CODEOWNERS.tmpl`**

```
# TEMPLATE — not live. scripts/init-repo.sh writes .github/CODEOWNERS from this
# only after verifying the team exists AND has write access to the repo.
#
# Why the ceremony: GitHub SILENTLY IGNORES a CODEOWNERS entry naming a team that
# does not exist or lacks write access. No error, no warning. The file would look
# like enforced review while enforcing nothing.
*  @Avenue-Z/TEAM_SLUG
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write `.github/dependabot.yml`**

`target-branch: dev` keeps dependabot inside the promotion chain, and pairs with the `dependabot/*` row in Task 3's matrix.

**Ship `github-actions` ONLY.** The stack-agnostic core has no `pyproject.toml` and no `package.json`, so declaring `pip` or `npm` here would make dependabot error with "manifest not found" on the template repo, and would leave a python repo carrying a dead npm block. `init-repo.sh` appends the block for the stack it selected (Task 7). Every repo then declares exactly the ecosystems it actually has.

```yaml
# Only github-actions here: it is the one ecosystem the stack-agnostic core actually has.
# scripts/init-repo.sh appends the pip OR npm block for the stack it selects.
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: "/"
    schedule: { interval: weekly }
    target-branch: dev
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md .github/CODEOWNERS.tmpl .github/dependabot.yml
git commit -m "chore: PR template, CODEOWNERS template, dependabot targeting dev"
```

---

### Task 6: Rulesets as code

**Files:**
- Create: `.github/rulesets/repo-ruleset.json`, `.github/rulesets/org-ruleset.json`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the job names `guard-base-branch` (Task 3) and `secret-scan` (Task 4).
- Produces: JSON consumed by `scripts/apply-rulesets.sh` (Task 8) via `gh api --input`.

Two traps this task exists to avoid, both of which brick a repo:
1. `required_approving_review_count: 1` on a solo repo → the author cannot approve their own PR → nothing is ever mergeable. **Use 0.**
2. A required check that does not exist does not fail — it hangs **pending forever**. The core has **no `ci`**, so `ci` must NOT appear here.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `.github/rulesets/repo-ruleset.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "avenue-z-branch-protection",
  "target": "branch",
  "enforcement": "active",
  "conditions": {
    "ref_name": {
      "include": ["refs/heads/main", "refs/heads/staging", "refs/heads/dev"],
      "exclude": []
    }
  },
  "bypass_actors": [
    { "actor_id": 1, "actor_type": "OrganizationAdmin", "bypass_mode": "always" }
  ],
  "rules": [
    { "type": "deletion" },
    { "type": "non_fast_forward" },
    {
      "type": "pull_request",

        "dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push": true,

        "require_last_push_approval": false,
        "required_review_thread_resolution": false
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "required_status_checks",
      "parameters": {
        "strict_required_status_checks_policy": false,
        "required_status_checks": [
          { "context": "guard-base-branch" },
          { "context": "secret-scan" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `.github/rulesets/org-ruleset.json`**

Same rules, org-scoped, targeting every repo. **Committed, not applied** — org rulesets require GitHub Team, and Avenue-Z is on Free.

```json
{
  "name": "avenue-z-branch-protection-org",
  "target": "branch",
  "enforcement": "active",
  "conditions": {
    "ref_name": {
      "include": ["refs/heads/main", "refs/heads/staging", "refs/heads/dev"],
      "exclude": []
    },
    "repository_name": { "include": ["~ALL"], "exclude": [] }
  },
  "bypass_actors": [
    { "actor_id": 1, "actor_type": "OrganizationAdmin", "bypass_mode": "always" }
  ],
  "rules": [
    { "type": "deletion" },
    { "type": "non_fast_forward" },
    {
      "type": "pull_request",
      "parameters": {
        "required_approving_review_count": 0,
        "dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push": true,
        "require_code_owner_review": false,
        "require_last_push_approval": false,
        "required_review_thread_resolution": false
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "required_status_checks",
      "parameters": {
        "strict_required_status_checks_policy": false,
        "required_status_checks": [
          { "context": "guard-base-branch" },
          { "context": "secret-scan" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Validate the JSON and assert `ci` is absent**

```bash
jq empty .github/rulesets/repo-ruleset.json && jq empty .github/rulesets/org-ruleset.json
! grep -q '"context": *"ci"' .github/rulesets/*.json && echo "OK: no 'ci' required (would hang pending)"
jq -r '.rules[] | select(.type=="pull_request") | .parameters.required_approving_review_count' \
  .github/rulesets/repo-ruleset.json
```
Expected: valid JSON, the `ci`-absent message, and `0`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add .github/rulesets/
git commit -m "chore: repo and org rulesets as code (org one is dormant until Team)"
```

### Task 7: `init-repo.sh` — criteria 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 15

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/init-repo.sh`, `tests/test_init_repo.sh`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `templates/<stack>/` (Tasks 9, 10), `.github/CODEOWNERS.tmpl` (Task 5).
- Produces: `init-repo.sh <python|node> [--team <slug>] [--no-push]`. `--no-push` exists so the tests can run without a remote.

Four invariants, each of which was a bug caught in review:

1. **Branch lineage.** `dev` still contains `templates/` until this script's commit removes it. Cut `staging` and `main` **after** that commit, or all three heads permanently carry dead files.
2. **`gh api`: 404 ≠ "couldn't tell."** `set -e` is disabled inside an `if` condition, so a bare `if ! gh api` treats an expired token exactly like a missing team and would silently drop CODEOWNERS. A 404 is an answer; anything else means **stop**.
3. **Idempotent on absence, not drift.** Create-if-absent, never force-push. Re-running does not reconcile a stale `main` — that is what a PR is for.
4. **`ci` is added to required checks only after `ci.yml` is in place.**

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — `tests/test_init_repo.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

source "${REPO_ROOT}/tests/lib.sh"

# Build a throwaway clone so we never mutate the real template.
WORK="$(mktemp -d)"
trap 'rm -rf "${WORK}"' EXIT
git clone -q "${REPO_ROOT}" "${WORK}/repo"
cd "${WORK}/repo"
git checkout -qb dev 2>/dev/null || git checkout -q dev

echo "init-repo: python"
./scripts/init-repo.sh python --no-push

# Criterion 15 — no head carries templates/
[ ! -d templates ] && pass "templates/ removed from working tree" || fail "templates/ still present"
for b in dev staging main; do
  if git ls-tree -r --name-only "$b" | grep -q '^templates/'; then
    fail "branch $b still contains templates/"
  else
    pass "branch $b is free of templates/"
  fi
done

# Criterion 3 — all three branches exist
for b in dev staging main; do
  git rev-parse --verify -q "$b" >/dev/null && pass "branch $b exists" || fail "branch $b missing"
done

# Criterion 1 — the python skeleton is real
[ -f pyproject.toml ] && pass "pyproject.toml copied" || fail "pyproject.toml missing"
[ -f .github/workflows/ci.yml ] && pass "ci.yml copied" || fail "ci.yml missing"

# Criterion 8 — no --team means no inert CODEOWNERS
[ ! -f .github/CODEOWNERS ] && pass "no CODEOWNERS without --team" || fail "inert CODEOWNERS shipped"
[ ! -f .github/CODEOWNERS.tmpl ] && pass "CODEOWNERS.tmpl removed" || fail "CODEOWNERS.tmpl left behind"

# Criterion 7 — re-run is a no-op, exit 0
if ./scripts/init-repo.sh python --no-push; then pass "re-run exits 0"; else fail "re-run failed"; fi

# Criterion 11 — a bogus team WARNS and exits 0; it does not set -e crash
cd "${WORK}" && rm -rf repo2 && git clone -q "${REPO_ROOT}" repo2 && cd repo2
git checkout -qb dev 2>/dev/null || git checkout -q dev
if out=$(./scripts/init-repo.sh python --team definitely-not-a-real-team --no-push 2>&1); then
  pass "bogus --team exits 0 (guarded, not fatal)"
  grep -qi 'does not exist' <<<"$out" && pass "warned about the missing team" || fail "no warning emitted"
  [ ! -f .github/CODEOWNERS ] && pass "no CODEOWNERS written for a bogus team" || fail "wrote CODEOWNERS anyway"
else
  fail "bogus --team crashed instead of warning (set -e trap)"
fi

finish
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it, watch it fail**

```bash
chmod +x tests/test_init_repo.sh && ./tests/test_init_repo.sh
```
Expected: FAIL — `scripts/init-repo.sh` does not exist.

### Task 8: `apply-rulesets.sh` — criterion 6

### Task 9: `templates/python/` — criterion 1

**Files:**
- Create: `templates/python/pyproject.toml`, `templates/python/.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `templates/python/Dockerfile`, `templates/python/.dockerignore`, `templates/python/src/app/__init__.py`, `templates/python/src/app/main.py`, `templates/python/tests/conftest.py`, `templates/python/tests/test_smoke.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: copied to the repo root by `init-repo.sh` (Task 7).
- Produces: a `ci.yml` whose job id is exactly **`ci`** — `apply-rulesets.sh` adds the context `"ci"`, and a mismatch hangs pending forever. This is criterion 13.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the skeleton test first**

`templates/python/tests/conftest.py`:

```python
"""Shared fixtures. Prefer hand-rolled fakes over mock — the org's convention."""
```

`templates/python/tests/test_smoke.py`:

```python
from app.main import greet


def test_greet_returns_a_greeting():
    assert greet("world") == "hello, world"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `pyproject.toml`**

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "app"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "TODO"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = []

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest>=8", "ruff>=0.6", "mypy>=1.11"]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/app"]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
pythonpath = ["src"]
testpaths = ["tests"]

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
target-version = "py311"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "I", "UP", "B"]

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.11"
strict = true
files = ["src"]
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

`templates/python/src/app/__init__.py`: (empty file)

`templates/python/src/app/main.py`:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"hello, {name}"
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify the skeleton passes its own gates**

```bash
cd templates/python
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -q -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q && ruff check . && mypy
deactivate && rm -rf .venv
cd ../..
```
Expected: 1 passed; ruff clean; mypy `Success`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write `templates/python/.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — job id **must** be `ci`

```yaml
name: ci

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [dev, staging, main]

jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - run: pip install -e ".[dev]"
      - run: ruff check .
      - run: mypy
      - run: pytest -q
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Write the Dockerfile (Cloud Run Job)**

`templates/python/Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY pyproject.toml ./
COPY src/ ./src/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir .
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "-m", "app.main"]
```

`templates/python/.dockerignore`:

```
.venv/
__pycache__/
.git/
tests/
docs/
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add templates/python
git commit -m "feat: python template — hatchling, ruff, mypy, pytest, ci job 'ci', Cloud Run Dockerfile"
```

---

### Task 10: `templates/node/` — criterion 2

**Files:**
- Create: `templates/node/package.json`, `templates/node/tsconfig.json`, `templates/node/eslint.config.mjs`, `templates/node/.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `templates/node/src/main.ts`, `templates/node/tests/smoke.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: a `ci.yml` whose job id is exactly **`ci`** — same contract as Task 9.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — `templates/node/tests/smoke.test.ts`

```typescript
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
import { greet } from "../src/main.js";

describe("greet", () => {
  it("returns a greeting", () => {
    expect(greet("world")).toBe("hello, world");
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `package.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "type": "module",
  "engines": { "node": ">=20" },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@eslint/js": "^9.12.0",
    "eslint": "^9.12.0",
    "typescript": "^5.6.0",
    "typescript-eslint": "^8.8.0",
    "vitest": "^2.1.0"
  }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write `tsconfig.json` and `eslint.config.mjs`**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["src", "tests"]
}
```

```javascript
import js from "@eslint/js";
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint";

export default tseslint.config(
  { ignores: ["node_modules/", "dist/"] },
  js.configs.recommended,
  ...tseslint.configs.recommended,
);
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the implementation** — `templates/node/src/main.ts`

```typescript
export function greet(name: string): string {
  return `hello, ${name}`;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify the skeleton passes its own gates**

```bash
cd templates/node
npm install
npm test && npm run lint && npm run typecheck
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
cd ../..
```
Expected: 1 test passed; eslint clean; tsc clean.

- [ ] **Step 6: Write `templates/node/.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — job id **must** be `ci`

```yaml
name: ci

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [dev, staging, main]

jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run typecheck
      - run: npm test
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add templates/node
git commit -m "feat: node template — vitest, eslint, tsc, ci job 'ci'"
```

### Task 11: Create the template repo and prove it works — criteria 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 14

**Files:** none created — this is live verification against GitHub.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything above.

This is the task that proves the design rather than asserting it. **The template repo is public** — it holds no secrets by construction, and public is what makes branch protection available on the Free plan.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the full local suite first**

```bash
./tests/test_gitignore.sh && ./tests/test_init_repo.sh && ./tests/test_apply_rulesets.sh
```
Expected: `ALL PASS` from each.

- [ ] **Step 2: Create the repo, public, default branch `dev`**

```bash
gh repo create Avenue-Z/repo-template --public \
  --description "Avenue Z repo template: main/staging/dev, conventions, CI, secret scanning" \
  --source . --remote origin --push
git branch -M dev 2>/dev/null || true
git push -u origin dev
gh api -X PATCH repos/Avenue-Z/repo-template -f default_branch=dev >/dev/null
gh api -X PATCH repos/Avenue-Z/repo-template -F is_template=true >/dev/null
gh repo view Avenue-Z/repo-template --json defaultBranchRef,isTemplate,visibility
```
Expected: `dev`, `true`, `PUBLIC`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Create `staging` and `main` from `dev`**

```bash
git branch staging dev && git branch main dev
git push -u origin staging main
gh api repos/Avenue-Z/repo-template/branches --jq '.[].name'
```
Expected: `dev`, `main`, `staging`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify the guard — criteria 4 and 14**

```bash
git checkout -b feat/guard-probe dev
echo "probe" >> docs/notes/.gitkeep && git commit -aqm "test: guard probe" && git push -u origin feat/guard-probe

gh pr create --base main --head feat/guard-probe --title "should FAIL" --body "feat/* must target dev"
sleep 45 && gh pr checks --watch || echo "FAILED AS EXPECTED (criterion 4)"
gh pr close --delete-branch=false "$(gh pr list --head feat/guard-probe --json number -q '.[0].number')"

gh pr create --base dev --head feat/guard-probe --title "should PASS" --body "feat/* -> dev"
sleep 45 && gh pr checks --watch && echo "PASSED AS EXPECTED"
```
Expected: base `main` → `guard-base-branch` **fails**. Base `dev` → **passes**.

Now the fail-closed case:

```bash
git checkout -b wip/unmatched dev && git push -u origin wip/unmatched
gh pr create --base dev --head wip/unmatched --title "should FAIL CLOSED" --body "unmatched prefix"
sleep 45 && gh pr checks --watch || echo "FAILED CLOSED AS EXPECTED (criterion 4)"
```
Expected: fails with "Unrecognized branch prefix".

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify `secret-scan` catches a `--no-verify` bypass — criterion 9**

This is the guarantee that matters: the hook is skippable, the CI job is not.

**Do not probe with AWS's published example key.** gitleaks' default AWS rule carries an allowlist
(`regexes = ['.+EXAMPLE$']`) that deliberately exempts any key ending in `EXAMPLE`. Probing with it
makes `secret-scan` **pass**, and you would wrongly conclude criterion 9 is satisfied while nothing
was caught. Change the trailing character so the allowlist does not match — the `PROBE=` line below
assembles the key at runtime, which also keeps a detectable literal out of this document (an earlier
draft embedded one, and the repo's own gitleaks hook correctly blocked the commit).

```bash
git checkout -b fix/leak-probe dev
PROBE="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPL"X   # built at runtime: a literal here would trip our own secret-scan
printf 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=%s\n' "$PROBE" > leak.txt
git add leak.txt && git commit --no-verify -qm "test: planted credential, hook bypassed"
git push -u origin fix/leak-probe
gh pr create --base dev --head fix/leak-probe --title "should FAIL secret-scan" --body "planted key"
sleep 60 && gh pr checks --watch || echo "SECRET-SCAN FAILED THE PR AS EXPECTED (criterion 9)"
gh pr close --delete-branch "$(gh pr list --head fix/leak-probe --json number -q '.[0].number')"
git push origin --delete fix/leak-probe && git checkout dev
```
Expected: `secret-scan` fails the PR even though the hook was bypassed.

- [ ] **Step 6: Apply the ruleset and confirm the repo is still usable — criteria 5 and 12**

Protection that bricks the repo is a **failed** criterion, not a passed one.

```bash
./scripts/apply-rulesets.sh --dry-run       # confirm: guard-base-branch + secret-scan, NO ci
./scripts/apply-rulesets.sh
gh api repos/Avenue-Z/repo-template/branches/main/protection --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'
```
Expected: `["guard-base-branch","secret-scan"]` — **`ci` absent**. If `ci` appears, every PR will hang pending and the repo is bricked.

Now prove a maintainer can still merge:

```bash
git checkout -b chore/protection-probe dev
echo "" >> README.md && git commit -aqm "chore: probe merge under protection" && git push -u origin chore/protection-probe
gh pr create --base dev --head chore/protection-probe --title "probe: mergeable under protection" --body "criterion 5"
sleep 60 && gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```
Expected: **merges**. A hang here means a required check never reported — check that the ruleset context strings equal the `jobs:` keys exactly.

- [ ] **Step 7: Clean up the probes and record the result**

```bash
git checkout dev && git pull
git push origin --delete feat/guard-probe wip/unmatched 2>/dev/null || true
gh pr list --state open
```
Expected: no open probe PRs.

### Task 12: End-to-end on a generated repo — criterion 13

**Files:** none — live verification of the case Task 11 structurally cannot cover.

**Why this task exists:** criterion 12 proves the required-check trap is avoided on the *template*, which by construction never has a `ci` check. That proves the trap is dodged in the one place it **cannot occur**. The trap actually lives in every *generated* repo, where `apply-rulesets.sh` adds a `ci` context that must match the `jobs.ci` key in the copied `ci.yml`. If it does not, every PR in every generated repo hangs pending forever — and template testing would never reveal it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Generate a throwaway repo from the template**

```bash
gh repo create Avenue-Z/tmpl-probe-python --private --template Avenue-Z/repo-template
sleep 5
git clone git@github.com:Avenue-Z/tmpl-probe-python.git /tmp/tmpl-probe && cd /tmp/tmpl-probe
git branch --show-current      # expect: dev  (Use-this-template copies the default branch only)
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Initialize it**

```bash
./scripts/init-repo.sh python
```
Expected: copies the stack, warns about no `--team`, removes `templates/`, commits once, pushes `dev`, then creates and pushes `staging` and `main`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify criteria 15, 3, 8, 1**

```bash
for b in dev staging main; do
  git ls-tree -r --name-only "origin/$b" | grep -q '^templates/' \
    && echo "FAIL: $b carries templates/" || echo "ok: $b clean"
done                                                   # criterion 15
gh api repos/Avenue-Z/tmpl-probe-python/branches --jq '.[].name'   # criterion 3
test ! -f .github/CODEOWNERS && echo "ok: no inert CODEOWNERS"     # criterion 8
pip install -e ".[dev]" -q && pytest -q && ruff check .            # criterion 1
```
Expected: three clean branches; `dev`/`main`/`staging`; no CODEOWNERS; tests and lint pass.

- [ ] **Step 4: The one that matters — `ci` must REPORT, not hang — criterion 13**

```bash
./scripts/apply-rulesets.sh
# Private repo on Free -> expect the honest SKIP message, exit 0 (criterion 6).
```

The repo is private on Free, so no ruleset applies. To test the *check-name* invariant — the actual trap — open a PR and confirm a check literally named `ci` reports a result:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/ci-probe dev
echo "" >> README.md && git commit -aqm "test: does the ci check report?" && git push -u origin feat/ci-probe
gh pr create --base dev --head feat/ci-probe --title "probe: ci reports" --body "criterion 13"
sleep 90
gh pr checks --json name,state -q '.[] | "\(.name)\t\(.state)"'
```
Expected: a row whose name is exactly **`ci`** with a state of `SUCCESS` (or `FAILURE`) — **never `PENDING`**. Also expect `guard-base-branch` and `secret-scan`.

**If no row named `ci` appears,** the job id in `templates/python/.github/workflows/ci.yml` does not match the `"context": "ci"` that `apply-rulesets.sh` adds. Fix the job id — that is the hang-pending bug, caught exactly where it lives.

- [ ] **Step 5: Repeat for node**

```bash
gh repo create Avenue-Z/tmpl-probe-node --private --template Avenue-Z/repo-template
git clone git@github.com:Avenue-Z/tmpl-probe-node.git /tmp/tmpl-probe-node && cd /tmp/tmpl-probe-node
./scripts/init-repo.sh node
git checkout -b feat/ci-probe dev && echo "" >> README.md
git commit -aqm "test: ci reports" && git push -u origin feat/ci-probe
gh pr create --base dev --head feat/ci-probe --title "probe: ci reports" --body "criterion 13 (node)"
sleep 90 && gh pr checks --json name,state -q '.[] | "\(.name)\t\(.state)"'
```
Expected: a check named exactly `ci`, reporting — not pending.

- [ ] **Step 6: Delete the probe repos**

```bash
gh repo delete Avenue-Z/tmpl-probe-python --yes
gh repo delete Avenue-Z/tmpl-probe-node --yes
rm -rf /tmp/tmpl-probe /tmp/tmpl-probe-node
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Record the outcome in the spec's review log**

Append a "Build verified — <date>" section to
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-avenue-z-repo-template-design.md` listing each of the 15 criteria
and whether it passed, with the command output that proves it. Commit on a `docs/*` branch and PR into
`dev`.

## Deferred: blocked on a GitHub Team upgrade

Not tasks — they cannot be executed on the Free plan. Do them the day Avenue-Z upgrades:

1. `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:org`, then `./scripts/apply-org-ruleset.sh --dry-run`
   and, once the plan looks right, `./scripts/apply-org-ruleset.sh` (it will make you type a
   challenge phrase — there is no `--yes`, and it cannot run unattended).
2. **Answer open question 1:** does a repo creator in Avenue-Z actually receive the Admin role?
3. **Answer open question 2:** does a repo-level bypass actor survive an org-level ruleset, or does the
   org ruleset outrank it? This determines whether the emergency-bypass design works at all.
4. Only after 2 and 3 are answered, write the confirmed behavior into `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
