# `require_code_owner_review: true` with `required_approving_review_count: 0` is the trap: it
# READS like enforced code-owner review while requiring no approval at all. That mismatch is how
# SECURITY.md came to claim CODEOWNERS "forces a human to review a change to the guard" when the
# shipped config forced nothing — the exact enforcement theater this repo exists to avoid.
#
# So the two flags move TOGETHER, or the suite fails:
#   count 0   + code-owner review off  -> review is NOT enforced. The current, deliberate choice
#                                         (solo maintainer). SECURITY.md documents it as an
#                                         ACCEPTED RISK, and must keep saying so.
#   count >=1 + code-owner review on   -> review IS enforced. Legitimate, but it means every PR
#                                         needs a second human. If you switch to this, REWRITE the
#                                         SECURITY.md section — it currently tells the reader they
