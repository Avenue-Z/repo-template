#   ./scripts/link-vercel.sh [--dry-run]
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# LINKING IS EASY. DEPLOYING IS A REVIEWED CODE CHANGE. That split is the whole design.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This script will:
#   * check you are logged into the Vercel CLI (it will NOT log you in — that is yours to do)
#   * REFUSE to link unless the repo's default branch is `main` (see why, below)
#   * run `vercel link` (interactive: you pick the scope and the project)
#   * establish that the production branch really is `main`, and REFUSE to finish if it is not:
#       - with VERCEL_TOKEN set, by asking the documented REST API (a real, machine-made check)
#       - without it, by making YOU read Branch Tracking in the dashboard and type what you see,
#         because the Vercel CLI genuinely cannot report it (no vercel command emits JSON)
#
# It will NOT:
#   * run `vercel deploy`, ever, under any flag
#   * enable any branch for deployment
#   * "fix" a wrong production branch behind your back
#   * claim to have verified something it did not. If it cannot check, it says so and makes a human
#     check — it never warns and carries on. (An earlier version did exactly that, and the check it
#     was "doing" could never have fired: it called `vercel project inspect --json`, a flag the CLI
#     does not have. template-tests/test_link_vercel.sh now contract-tests the CLI surface so an
#     invented flag fails the suite instead of silently disabling the control.)
#
# WHY THE PRODUCTION-BRANCH CHECK IS THE POINT OF THIS SCRIPT
#
# Vercel picks the production branch from `main`, `master`, or THE REPOSITORY'S DEFAULT BRANCH.
# There is NO documented API to set it — only an undocumented endpoint the dashboard calls.
# Vercel's own official workaround is "use the repository default branch".
#
# This template's default branch is `main` precisely so that Vercel's default is CORRECT. If the
# default branch is ever changed back to `dev`, then `dev` becomes the production branch, and
# EVERY MERGE TO dev DEPLOYS STRAIGHT TO PRODUCTION — bypassing staging, inverting the entire
# branch flow, silently. No error, no warning. That is the failure this check exists to catch.
#
# So we verify rather than assume, and a failure to verify is never treated as a verified pass.
#
# DEPLOYS ARE OFF UNTIL A HUMAN TURNS THEM ON
#
# vercel.json ships `"git": {"deploymentEnabled": false}`. Vercel treats every UNSPECIFIED branch
# as deployable, so `false` is the only posture that is safe by default. Enabling a branch means
# editing vercel.json — which means a PR, which means review and the branch flow. Runaway deploys
# are not prevented here by a warning nobody reads; they are prevented by the fact that turning a
# deploy on is a reviewed change to a tracked file.

# --------------------------------------------------------- verify what Vercel ACTUALLY thinks
# A project may carry an explicit productionBranch override, set by hand in the dashboard, and
# that override WINS over the repository default branch we verified above. So the gh check alone
# is not sufficient — we have to ask Vercel.
#
# THE CLI CANNOT ANSWER THIS. `vercel project inspect` has NO --json flag (checked against CLI
# 54.7.1; no vercel command does), and its human-readable output is not a contract worth parsing.
# An earlier version of this script called `vercel project inspect --json`, which the real CLI
# rejects as an unknown option — so the check silently returned nothing, fell through to a
# warning, and LINKED ANYWAY. It was verification theatre: it could never have caught anything.
# Its tests passed only because the stub implemented a flag that does not exist.
#
# So there are exactly two honest paths, and neither of them is "warn and carry on":
#
#   VERCEL_TOKEN set -> ask the documented REST API (GET /v9/projects/{id}) and REFUSE on a
#                       wrong answer. This is a real check.
#   no token         -> we CANNOT verify. Say so, and make a HUMAN confirm they have looked,
#                       because "I could not check" is not "it is fine". That is this repo's
#                       first rule, and the old code broke it.

Linked. NOTHING IS DEPLOYING, and nothing will, until you say so.

vercel.json ships:   "git": { "deploymentEnabled": false }

To enable deploys, edit vercel.json and open a PR — that is the gate. Enabling a deploy is a
reviewed change to a tracked file, not a click. For this repo's branch flow that means:

    "git": {
      "deploymentEnabled": {
        "main": true,        # production
        "staging": true,     # pre-prod soak
        "dev": false         # integration branch — leave off unless you want a running preview
      }
    }

Anything you do NOT list defaults to TRUE in Vercel, so list every branch you care about.
