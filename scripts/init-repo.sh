#
# --team <slug>: writes .github/CODEOWNERS naming @Avenue-Z/<slug>, after verifying the
#   team exists. If the team exists but lacks write access to the repo, the script GRANTS
#   it push (write) access rather than just warning — GitHub silently ignores a CODEOWNERS
#   entry for a team without write, so a warning nobody actions leaves the file inert.
#   Granting requires repo-admin or org-owner rights; if that fails the script dies rather
#   than write a CODEOWNERS that GitHub will ignore.
#
#   THIS IS A REAL PERMISSION CHANGE ON GITHUB. `--team` may add the team to the repo with
#   push access (PUT orgs/<org>/teams/<slug>/repos/<owner>/<repo>). It is documented here, in
#   README.md and in CONTRIBUTING.md. Omit --team and the script touches no permissions.
#
#   If this working copy has no GitHub remote yet, there is no repo to check write access
#   against: the file is still written, but the script warns LOUDLY that it may be inert.
#   Any OTHER failure to identify the repo (auth, network, rate limit) is fatal — a failure
#   to verify is never treated as a verified pass.
