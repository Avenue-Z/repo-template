# DEPENDABOT IS BLIND TO templates/. THIS TEST IS WHAT KEEPS THEM FROM ROTTING.
#
# .github/dependabot.yml declares the github-actions ecosystem at `directory: "/"`, and for that
# ecosystem dependabot scans the ROOT .github/workflows ONLY. So it bumps the core workflows
# (guard-base-branch, secret-scan) and NEVER touches:
#
#     templates/python/.github/workflows/ci.yml
#     templates/node/.github/workflows/ci.yml
#     templates/next/.github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# Those files are not workflows *of this repo* — they are payload, copied into a generated repo by
# init-repo.sh, where they land at the root and dependabot finally sees them. Which means: a
# generated repo keeps its actions current, but THE TEMPLATE ITSELF ships whatever version it was
# born with, forever, silently. Every new repo starts life on a stale action.
#
# There is no dependabot config that fixes this (it will not scan a nested .github/workflows for
# the github-actions ecosystem). So the fix is a LOCKSTEP TEST, the same idiom this repo already
# uses to keep the gitleaks version in secret-scan.yml matched to the pre-commit hook:
#
#     any action used in BOTH the core and a template must be pinned to the SAME SHA.
#
# Dependabot bumps the core -> this suite goes red -> whoever merges the dependabot PR must bump
# the templates too. The rot becomes a failing test instead of a silent decay.
#
# SHA-PINNED, NOT TAG-PINNED. A version tag (v7) is MUTABLE: a compromised action maintainer can
# repoint it to malicious code and every consumer picks it up on the next run (the 2025
# tj-actions/changed-files compromise). A commit SHA is immutable and closes that vector. So every
# action is pinned to a full 40-hex commit SHA, with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment for humans and for
# Dependabot (which bumps SHA pins, updating BOTH the SHA and the comment). The lockstep check
# below keys on the SHA — the immutable thing — not the comment.
