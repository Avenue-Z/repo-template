# link-vercel.sh attaches a repo to a DEPLOY TARGET. Two things must hold, forever:
#
#   1. IT NEVER DEPLOYS. Not with a flag, not by accident, not as a "convenience".
#   2. IT NEVER LINKS A REPO WHOSE DEFAULT BRANCH IS NOT `main`.
#
#      Vercel takes its production branch from the repository default branch, and there is NO
#      documented API to set it otherwise. This template's default branch is `main` precisely so
#      that Vercel's default is correct. If someone flips it back to `dev`, then every merge to
#      `dev` deploys straight to PRODUCTION — bypassing staging, inverting the branch flow,
#      silently, with no error. This check is the only thing standing in front of that.
#
# Both are driven with stub `vercel` / `gh` on PATH, so no real API call is ever made.

# SHAPE CONTRACT — assert the script handles the REAL response shapes, not the ones we assumed.
#
# The CLI-flag contract above is only half the lesson. The `--json` bug was an invented FLAG; the
# link:null bug was an invented response SHAPE — the stub emitted {"link":{"productionBranch":null}}
# for a not-connected project, but the real API (verified against a live project, 2026-07-15)
# returns {"link":null}. Both were fiction the stub made true. So pin the three shapes the live API
# actually produces, and assert the script has a distinct, non-green-tick branch for each:
#
#   {"link":null}                              -> no Git connection at all      -> REFUSE
#   {"link":{"productionBranch":null}}         -> connected, branch unreadable  -> REFUSE
#   {"link":{"productionBranch":"main"|"dev"}} -> connected, real branch        -> compare to main
#
# These are static presence checks, so they run even without the CLI: they stop a future refactor
# from collapsing the three shapes back into one and silently reviving the green-tick.

# bug, and pin that a not-single-project repo.json is refused rather than guessed.
